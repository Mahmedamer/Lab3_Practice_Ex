/*
The include gards "#ifndef" checks whether the given token has been #defined earlier
in the file or in an included file; if not, it includes the code between
it and the closing #else or, if no #else is present, #endif statement.
#ifndef is often used to make header files idempotent by defining a token
once the file has been included and checking that the token was not set at the top of that file.
To understand why not using the guards will cause a problem, check this link

*******[Important Note]*******:
You can create the class .h and .cpp quickly in visual studio by:
- Right click or project name in "Solution Explorer"
- Add + Class
- press Add button
- choose the name of the class in "Class Name" and press Ok
You'll find the .h and .cpp created with default constructor and destructor
and with "#pragma once" which is one sentence but makes the same functionality of #ifndef, #define and #endif
